# Getting Started with this app.

to start the api/backend
-npm run api

to start the frontend
-npm start

you should be in the root folder of the project when
doing the commands, do them in two different windows even
thou we added the backend to run on port:3333 so it wont conflict
with port:3000

git is also added for keeping track of progress use
-git log
to find see what happened.
